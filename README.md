# Harmonisation of curation of respiratory disease datasets across the UK

## Aims and objectives

The aims of this project were to speed up research into respiratory diseases - Asthma, Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - and enable comparisons of the diseases across the UK. 

The objectives were to share and harmonise methodology for curating research-ready (and non-project-specific) datasets for these diseases across different electronic health record (EHR) databases in the UK and generate consistent phenotype and variable definitions regardless of coding system. The EHR databases utilised in this project were the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum for England; Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank for Wales; and DataLoch for South-East Scotland.

## Content

The codelists used for the phenotypes and variables are made publicly available here for transparency and reproducibility. Additionally, we have included the Stata scripts used for curation in CPRD Aurum.

## Published papers

Note that the relevant papers will soon be published, with links to be added here when available.
